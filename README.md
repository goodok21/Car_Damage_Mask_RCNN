# Mask R-CNN for Car Scratch, Wheel and Mirror Detection

This POC is based on [@matterport](https://github.com/matterport)'s [Mask R-CNN implementation](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN).

Pre-trained Mask R-CNN model on the COCO data set is used for further training on customized data set.
